Welcome to my attempt at the Static Site Generator (SSG) project.
This is an almost hands-off project created by boot.dev.

The aim of this project is to be able to take a load of markdown, and convert that into a functioning website.
With regards to the amount of attention to detail we're allowed to put in is up to us. I did my best to account for edge cases to the best of my ability when considering embedded markdown e.g., a text with bold and italic markdown.

I say this project is almost hands-off because the only help we're given is the direction of what we're supposed to build and how it should look like by the end of each chapter. Otherwise, how it functions to get to the end result is completely up to the programmer.
I did use Boots to the best of my ability, especially towards the end when working with edge cases, but I think this was a good lesson into how not to use AI when it comes to coding. From what I've learnt, AI has been really useful when looking at small, specific blocks of code, especially when it comes to picking out simple mistakes.
Boots has also been really helpful in bouncing off ideas and seeing if my logic makes sense. There would be lots of times where we would be discussing how best to match a constraint and to what extent it is worth doing so.
